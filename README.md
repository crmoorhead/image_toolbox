# image_toolbox

A collection of tools useful for image manipulation and creation of data augmentation policies. 

## Image interaction

- image_dict (source_dir,*args): Rather than work with all images in the workspace, this creates a dictionary of all filepaths in a given directory. It will only add files of type .jpg, .bmp or .png to the dictionary. It has two optional arguments, "size" and "type" which will also add information on the dimensions and file type of each file.
